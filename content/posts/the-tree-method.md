## Introduction

The tree method is a way to organize your thoughts/notes in your favorite note taking app, for the sake of this example I’ll be using notion.

Before we begin, I wanna tell you that IDK if something like this already has a name, but it’s just what I’ve started doing, after using PARA for a long time.

The top level page represents the inbox for your mind, everything you are thinking you keep dumping into it, and naturally the topics that emerges you keep adding into this page as a page thus creating a tree like structure.


I find this method better as it’s the easiest and takes no effort in comparison to PARA that requires some thought to where to put your page. In the Tree Method one can mindlessly add stuff to the top page without thinking about where it goes or add top level pages which can be later reorganised if you feel like it, so it gives to flexibility on the effort you wanna put into it.
