I am a blockchain developer. I worked at [Instaraise](https://instaraise.io) as a blockchain developer for a while. I love 🏗 building things, they're mostly toy projects. I was a part of [Tezos India Fellowship 2.0](https://tif2.devfolio.co/), [Antler India Fellowship](https://www.antler.co/india-fellowship) and the most recently [Polygon India Fellowship](https://polygon.technology/polygon-fellowship/).

## 🏗 Creations

**[⚖️ Git DAO](https:/gitdao.app)**

Launch DAO for your Github repositories with a few clicks on polygon.

**[📈 Liquibrium](http://testnet.liquibrium.finance/)**

DEX for stable/similar assets to swap at v low slippage on tezos.

**[🎟 Chiketto](https://chiketto.vercel.app/)**

Create NFT tickets for your event with a few clicks on Tezos. Tickets can be resell on secondary market places like [Objkt](https://objkt.com/) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/).

**[🖼 Make My NFT](https://makemynft.vivek.biz/)**

Launch your NFT collections without any BS on Tezos. These collections then can be listed on marketplaces like [Objkt](https://objkt.com/) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/).

There are a few more lil toy inventions that I did but they're not that mature, like [Dead](https://github.com/vivekascoder/dead_json) Json](https://github.com/vivekascoder/dead_json), [Tezos art engine](https://github.com/vivekascoder/tezos_art_engine), [Skull](https://github.com/vivekascoder/skull) etc.
