## What it's about ?
Coding a site that shows the list of clean NFTs list early to the poeple in the
Tezos community. It'll help them find early NFTs project quickly.


## Things we'll need.
1. Landing page where'll display the list.
2. A page to add more. (Approved by me)
3. Feedback form.
4. Buy button, talking about shitty subscription plan, with two button (yay,
   nay) whether I should add it or not.
