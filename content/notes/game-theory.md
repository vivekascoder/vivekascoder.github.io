## Prisoner's Dilemma and Strict Dominance

### Situation

Two suspectss are arrested, the police think that they were trying to rob a store. But the cops can only prove that the suspects were trespassing.

Thus the police need one of criminals to rat out the other.

### Police's Deal

If no one confess then the police can only charge both of them for trespassing (1 month). If one of them confesses then the police will severely punish the other one (12 months) and let the first one go (0 months).

If both of them confesses then both will get equal punishment (8 months).

The above situation can be denoted as follow.

### Question

Let the thieves only want to minimize the no. of months that they spend in jail, what should they do ?

### Situation 1

When player 1 knows that the other one i.e player 2 will keep quiet then in order to reduce his no. of months in jail he should confess (0 months) rather than keeping quiet and spending 1 month in jail.

### Situation 2

When the player 1 knows that the other one i.e player 2 will confess then in order to minimize his monts in jail he should confess (8 months) rather than keeping quiet and spending 12 months.

### Conclusion

If you see the above 2 situation, you'll find that the best case for bothe of them indivisually is to confess to minimize their months in jail because they only care about themselves.

That's why there's is only one sensible outcome i.e both players to confess.
