## What are Royalties ?

When your NFT's has royalties, then on any trade in the secondary market i.e after the crowdsale/initial sale is done, the creator of the NFT or any other address (specified while initializing) will get a % of royalties for those sales. You can also have a way to whitelist certain addressess to not pay royalties by making a map, other addresses can be added to this map by the creator (or any other address specified while deployment or it depends on how you're coding it).
